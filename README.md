# Hack: Recursive Factorial Function with Stack Overflow Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: stack overflow. The `foo` function calculates the factorial of a number.  However, it lacks error handling for negative inputs, leading to infinite recursion and a stack overflow. The solution provides a corrected version with input validation.
